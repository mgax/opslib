This tutorial will walk you through deploying Gitea using opslib. We will run
it locally at first, using docker-compose, set up backups, configure a Git
repository, then deploy it to a VPS, and expose it to the Internet using a
Cloudflare tunnel.

The completed project is available at
https://github.com/mgax/opslib/tree/main/examples/tutorial; feel free to
reference it if the code snippets in the tutorial are confusing.
